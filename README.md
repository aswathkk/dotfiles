# Dotfiles

My OSX / Linux dotfiles.

## About this project

I've seen a lot of people maintaining personalized configurations for their 
machine in a `dotfile` repository. This is my attempt of doing so.

## Install

Run this:
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/aswathkk/dotfiles

# Get inside the cloned directory
cd dotfiles

# Run bootstrap script to install dependencies
bash bootstrap.sh

# Source sourceme.sh file to see thing in action !
# You can also add this command in your .bashrc if required. 
source sourceme.sh
```

### NeoVim

After starting NeoVim, run `:PlugInstall` to install plugins.
